🐍 Python Projects

Welcome to the Python side of my portfolio where I dive into data cleaning, exploration, and modelling with the occasional overuse of pandas.
This folder holds my collection of scripts, notebooks, and experiments showing how I use Python to uncover insights, automate workflows, and build predictive models.

🧠 What You’ll Find

Each project folder includes:

Jupyter notebooks or scripts – the main analysis and code walkthrough.

Data (or data sources) – real or mock datasets for testing.

A README.md – explaining the purpose, dataset, and methods used.

Visuals – plots, charts, and results generated from the analysis.

Thank you for reading.
