<h1 align="center">SafeMeds AI - Machine Learning Performance Dashboard</h1>

<p align="center">
  The <strong>SafeMeds AI Machine Learning Performance Dashboard</strong> is a Power BI project designed to visualise and compare the performance of several machine learning classifiers trained on <strong>paracetamol adverse drug reaction (ADR)</strong> data. 
  The goal of these models is to predict the <strong>seriousness of ADRs</strong> to assist in clinical triage and safety monitoring. 
  This dashboard enables stakeholders to easily assess which model provides the most accurate, reliable, and explainable results for medical decision support.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The underlying dataset contains features related to patient reports, reaction severity, and medical classifications associated with paracetamol usage. 
  Multiple ML models, including <strong>Logistic Regression (LR)</strong>, <strong>Random Forest (RF)</strong>, and <strong>XGBoost</strong>, were trained and evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. 
  Power BI was used to create a dynamic and interpretable dashboard where performance metrics and visual comparisons of model outputs can be easily explored.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The visualisations below showcase the aggregated <strong>overview of model performance</strong>, followed by detailed pages for each model. 
  These dashboards provide a unified view of how each classifier performed under the same dataset conditions, offering transparency into model behavior and supporting data-driven selection of the best algorithm for deployment.
