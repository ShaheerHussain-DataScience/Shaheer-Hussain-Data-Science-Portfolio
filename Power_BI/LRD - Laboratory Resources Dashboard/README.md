<h1 align="center">Laboratory Resources Dashboard</h1>

<p align="center">
  The <strong>Laboratory Resources Dashboard</strong> is my Power BI solution designed to monitor and manage laboratory operations, equipment, and order data. 
  It integrates multiple data sources, including equipment and order master lists, to provide a centralised overview of laboratory resource utilisation. 
  The dashboard helps stakeholders make informed decisions by visualising trends, capacity, and efficiency across laboratory operations.
</p>

<p align="center">
  This project demonstrates how data-driven dashboards can support operational management in healthcare or research environments. 
  Key metrics such as equipment usage, order volumes, and departmental workloads are tracked in real time to identify bottlenecks and optimise performance. 
  Using Power BIâ€™s interactive capabilities, users can filter, drill down, and compare key performance indicators (KPIs) across various laboratory departments.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The dataset includes two key components: a <strong>Laboratory Equipment Master List</strong> and a <strong>Laboratory Orders Master List</strong>. 
  Together, these provide the foundation for analyzing resource allocation, maintenance schedules, and order flow. 
  The dashboard supports improved planning and decision-making by aligning laboratory demand with resource availability.
