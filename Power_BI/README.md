ðŸ“Š Power BI Projects

Welcome to my Power BI corner â€” where spreadsheets meet storytelling and data comes to life with a bit of colour, structure, and DAX magic
This folder includes a collection of interactive dashboards Iâ€™ve built to explore different datasets and solve real-world problems. Each project focuses on data modelling, visual design, and clear insights for decision-making.

ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Find

Each subfolder contains:

The .pbix file â€“ the actual Power BI report (I will include where I can).
A short project write-up â€“ explaining the purpose, dataset, and key insights.
Screenshots or GIFs â€“ for a quick preview of the dashboard.
Notes on techniques used â€“ like DAX measures, custom visuals, or performance tips.

ðŸ§° Skills & Techniques

Some of the Power BI skills youâ€™ll see in these projects include:
DAX calculations & measures
Data modelling and relationships
Power Query transformations (M language)
Custom visuals & report design principles
UX/UI thinking for dashboard layout
Connecting to live sources (SharePoint, Excel, APIs)

Thank you for Reading.
