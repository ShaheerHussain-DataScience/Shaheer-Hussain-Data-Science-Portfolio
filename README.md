👋 Hey there, I’m Shaheer Hussain

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio — a collection of my projects in Power BI, Python, and Tableau, where I turn raw data into stories, insights, and dashboards that (hopefully) make people go, “Ohhh, that’s interesting!” 😄

🧠 About Me

I’m a Data Analyst Apprentice at the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), working in the Data Science team.
During Work, I build dashboards and reports that help teams make smarter, data-driven decisions, But in my free time I experiment with Python, Power BI, and Tableau, exploring ways to make data not just useful, but visually engaging.
I’m currently working towards a BSc (Hons) in Digital and Technology Solutions (Data Analytics) at ADA, the National College for Digital Skills, and I’m set to graduate in 2025.

📊 What You’ll Find Here

This repo is a growing collection of projects that reflect my journey as a data analyst — from early experiments to polished dashboards (Due to the creation date of this Portfolio, Many dates may not add up which means a lot of projects you will see is older work.
You’ll find:

Power BI Projects – Interactive dashboards for real-world datasets (business performance, surveys, SharePoint analytics, and more).
Python Projects – Data cleaning, EDA, predictive modeling, and a few ML experiments.
Tableau Dashboards – Clean and story-driven visualizations that highlight key insights.

Each project folder includes a brief description, visuals, and sometimes a write-up on the logic or design decisions.

⚙️ Tech & Tools

Here’s what I usually work with:

Power BI (DAX, M, data modeling, report design)
Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn, numpy)
Tableau Public
SQL (data extraction and transformation)
SharePoint & Excel (for real-world data connections)
GitHub Pages (for portfolio hosting)

🚀 Current Focus

Improving storytelling through data visualization 
Building cleaner, automated Python pipelines
Sharing projects that demonstrate both technical depth and UI/UX design thinking

📬 Let’s Connect!
