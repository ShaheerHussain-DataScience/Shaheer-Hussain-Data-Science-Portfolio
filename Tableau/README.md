ðŸŽ¨ Tableau Projects

Welcome to the Tableau section of my portfolio â€” currently a work in progress, but soon to be filled with colourful dashboards, interactive visuals, and a lot of experimentation! 
Iâ€™m in the process of learning Tableau to expand my data visualization toolkit alongside Power BI and Python. My goal is to master Tableauâ€™s drag-and-drop magic while applying strong data storytelling and UX design principles Iâ€™ve developed through other tools.

ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Find (Eventually ðŸ˜…)

Once I start publishing Tableau projects, you can expect:
Interactive dashboards showcasing real or open datasets.
Project write-ups explaining the goals, datasets, and insights.
Visual design notes highlighting choices around color, layout, and interactivity.
Tableau Public links so you can explore dashboards online.

ðŸŽ¯ My Learning Goals

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m aiming to get comfortable with as I learn Tableau:
Data connection and prep using Tableau Prep / Data Source pane
Calculated fields and parameter controls
Dashboard design and layout best practices
Storytelling with multiple views
Performance optimisation for large datasets

Thank you for Reading.
