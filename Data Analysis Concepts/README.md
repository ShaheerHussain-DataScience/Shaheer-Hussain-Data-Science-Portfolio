ðŸ§® Data Analysis & Data Science Notes

Welcome to my Data Analysis & Data Science Knowledge Hub â€” a place where I share my learning journey, notes, and examples from exploring the world of data.
Think of this as a digital notebook where I document concepts, mini-projects, and visual explanations of topics like descriptive analytics, data visualisation principles, and machine learning basics.

ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Find

This section is all about understanding how and why things work in data analysis â€” not just the code or charts.
Hereâ€™s the kind of content youâ€™ll see here:

Descriptive Analytics â€“ Summarising and interpreting data using statistics and visuals.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Finding patterns, outliers, and insights from raw data.

Inferential & Predictive Concepts â€“ Notes on regression, classification, and model evaluation.

Data Science Fundamentals â€“ Things like bias/variance, overfitting, or data preprocessing.

Screenshots & Visuals â€“ Snapshots of my work in Power BI, Python, or notebooks to illustrate ideas.

Thank you for Reading.
