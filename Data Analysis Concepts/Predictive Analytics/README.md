<h1 align="center">Predictive Analytics</h1>

<p align="center">
  Predictive analytics uses statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyse current and historical data 
  in order to make informed predictions about future outcomes. It goes beyond describing ‚Äúwhat happened‚Äù by forecasting 
  ‚Äúwhat is likely to happen,‚Äù enabling data-driven decision-making across business, healthcare, and research domains. 
  Common applications include customer churn prediction, risk assessment, demand forecasting, and anomaly detection. 
  This process typically involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to ensure reliable 
  and interpretable predictions.

  In this example, predictive analytics is demonstrated using a breast cancer dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant 
  or benign. The process begins by analysing the dataset‚Äôs class distribution and correlation between features, followed by 
  visualising the performance of different classification models. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, 
  and ROC-AUC are used to evaluate how well the model generalises. Feature importance rankings further highlight the 
  most influential variables contributing to predictions, supporting explainability in the analytical process.

  Python libraries such as <code>scikit-learn</code>, <code>matplotlib</code>, and <code>seaborn</code> are used to build, visualise, 
  and interpret the results of the predictive model. These visualisations collectively illustrate each step of the workflow ‚Äî 
  from understanding data balance and correlations, to assessing performance metrics through confusion matrices and ROC curves. 
  The combination of robust algorithms and visualisation techniques provides both interpretability and accuracy, making predictive 
  analytics an essential component in modern data science.
