<h1 align="center">Descriptive Analytics</h1>

<p align="center">
  Descriptive analytics is the process of analysing historical data to understand trends, patterns, and insights about what has already happened. 
  It focuses on summarising large datasets into meaningful information using statistics such as averages, counts, percentages, and distributions. 
  The main goal is to answer the question <strong>‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù</strong> by providing context and clarity to raw data, making it easier for decision-makers 
  to interpret and act upon.
</p>

<p align="center">
  In <strong>Power BI</strong>, descriptive analytics can be effectively displayed through interactive dashboards and visualisations. 
  Users can connect data sources, clean and transform data using Power Query, and create visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, histograms, and tables 
  to represent summaries and trends. Tools like slicers, filters, and drill-through actions allow users to explore data dynamically, 
  helping identify key metrics such as sales growth, customer behavior, or operational performance over time.
</p>

<p align="center">
  In <strong>Python</strong>, descriptive analytics can be performed using libraries such as <code>pandas</code>, <code>numpy</code>, and <code>matplotlib</code>. 
  Data can be loaded, cleaned, and summarized using functions like <code>.describe()</code>, <code>.groupby()</code>, and <code>.value_counts()</code>. 
  Visualisations can then be created using <code>matplotlib</code> or <code>seaborn</code> to illustrate patterns, correlations, and distributions within the data. 
  Python‚Äôs flexibility also allows for automated reporting and integration with machine learning workflows, making it a powerful tool for both 
  exploratory and explanatory data analysis.
